Suppose that a complex $n\times n$ matrix $A$ has distinct eigenvalues $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n$, and let $v_1,\dots,v_n$ be eigenvectors with these eigenvalues.
1. Show that every eigenvector is a multiple of one of the vectors $v_i$.
2. Show how one can recover the matrix from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
