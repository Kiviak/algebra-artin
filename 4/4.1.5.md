1. Let $U$ and $W$ be vector spaces over a field $F$. Show that the two operations $(u,w)+(u',w')=(u+u',w+w')$ and $c(u,w)=(cu,cw)$ on pairs of vectors make the product set $U\times W$ into a vector space. It is called the product space.
2. Let $U$ and $W$ be subspaces of a vector space $V$. Show that the map $T:U\times W\to V$ defined by $T((u,w))=u+w$ is a linear transformation.
3. Express the dimension formula for $T$ in terms of the dimensions of subspaces of $V$.
