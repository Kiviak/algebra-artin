Let
$A=\begin{bmatrix}
   a & b   \\
   c & d 
\end{bmatrix}$ 
be a $2\times 2$ matrix with eigenvalue $\lambda$.
1. Show that unless it is zero, the vector $(b,\lambda -a)^t$ is an eigenvector.
2. Find a matrix $P$ such that $P^{-1}AP$ is diagonal, assuming that $b\not=0$ and that $A$ has distinct eigenvalues.
