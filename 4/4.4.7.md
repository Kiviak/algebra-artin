Let
$A=\begin{bmatrix}
   a & b \\
   c & d 
\end{bmatrix}$
be a real $2\times 2$ matrix. The condition that a column vector $X$ be an eigenvector for left multiplication by $A$ is that $AX=Y$ be a scalar multiple of $X$, which means that the slopes $s=x_2/x_1$ and $s'=y_2/y_1$ are equal.
1. Find the equation in $s$ that expresses this equality.
2. Suppose that the entries of $A$ are positive real numbers. Prove that there is an eigenvector in the first quadrant and also one in the second quadrant.
