Let $V$ be a vector space with basis $(v_0,\dots,v_n)$ and let $(a_0,\dots,a_n)$ be scalars. Define a linear operator $T$ on $V$ by the rules $T(v_i)=v_{i+1}$ if $i<n$ and $T(v_n)=\sum_{i=0}^n a_i v_i$. Determine the matrix of $T$ with respect to the given basis, and the characteristic polynomial of $T$.
