1. Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, such that $T^2$ is the identity operator. Prove that for any vector $v$ in $V$, $v-Tv$ is either an eigenvector with eigenvalue $-1$, or the zero vector. With notation as in Exercise $4.1$, prove that $V$ is the direct sum of the eigenspaces $V^{(1)}$ and $V^{(-1)}$.
2. Generalize this method to prove that a linear operator $T$ such that $T^4=I$ decomposes a complex vector space into a sum of four eigenspaces.
