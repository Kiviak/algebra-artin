Let $P$ be the real vector space of polynomials $p(x)=a_0+a_1x+\dots+a_nx^n$ of degree at most $n$, and let $D$ denote the derivative $\frac{d}{dx}$, considered as a linear operator on $P$. 
1. Prove that $D$ is a nilpotent operator, meaning that $D^k=0$ for sufficiently large $k$.
2. Find the matrix of $D$ with respect to a convenient basis.
3. Determine all $D$-invariant subspaces of $P$.
