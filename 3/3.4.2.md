1. Determine the basechange matrix in $\R^2$, when the old basis is the standard basis $E=(e_1,e_2)$ and the new basis is $B=(e_1+e_2,e_1-e_2)$.
2. Determine the basechange matrix in $\R^n$, when the old basis is the standard basis $E$ and the new basis is $B=(e_n,e_{n-1},\cdots,e_1)$.
3. Let $B$ be the basis of $\R^2$ in which $v_1=e_1$ and $v_2$ is a vector of unit length making an angle of $120^\circ$ with $v_1$. Determine the basechange matrix that relates $E$ to $B$.
