With the notation of Exercise $7.2$, each of the following subsets $R$ of the $(x,y)$-plane defines a relation on the set $\R$ of real numbers. Determine which of the axioms $(2.7.3)$ are satisfied:
1. the set $\{(s,s): s \in \R \}$. 
2. the empty set. 
3. the locus $\{ xy+1=0 \}$.
4. the locus $\{ x^2y-xy^2-x+y=0 \}$.
