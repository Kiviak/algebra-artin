1. Define the greatest common divisor of a set $\{a_1,\cdots,a_n\}$ of $n$ integers. Prove that it exists, and that it is an integer combination of $a_1,\cdots,a_n$.
2. Prove that if the greatest common divisor of $\{a_1,\cdots,a_n\}$ is $d$, then the greatest common divisor of $\{a_1/d,\cdots,a_n/d\}$ is 1.
