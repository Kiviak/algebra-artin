In the definition of a subgroup, the identity element in $H$ is required to be the identity of $G$. One might require only that $H$ have an identity element, not that it need be the same as the identity in $G$. Show that if $H$ has an identity at all, then it is the identity in $G$. Show that the analogous statement is true for inverses.
