Let $G$ be the group of upper triangular real matrices
$\begin{bmatrix}
   a & b \\
   0 & d
\end{bmatrix}$
with $a$ and $d$ different from zero. For each of the following subsets, determine whether or not $S$ is a subgroup, and whether or not $S$ is a normal subgroup. If $S$ is a normal subgroup, identify the quotient group $G/S$.
1. $S$ is the subset defined by $b=0$.
2. $S$ is the subset defined by $d=1$.
3. $S$ is the subset defined by $a=d$.
