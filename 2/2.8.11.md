Let $G$ and $H$ be the following subgroups of $GL_2(\R)$:
$G=\left\{\begin{bmatrix}
   x & y \\
   0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}\right\},
H=\left\{\begin{bmatrix}
   x & 0 \\
   0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}\right\}$
with $x$ and $y$ real and $x>0$. An element of $G$ can be represented by a point in the right half plane. Make sketches showing the partitions of the half plane into left cosets and into right cosets of $H$.
