Let $P$ be a partition of a group $G$ with the property that for any pair of elements $A,B$ of the partition, the product set $AB$ is contained entirely within another element $C$ of the partition. Let $N$ be the element of $P$ that contains $1$. Prove that $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and that $P$ is the set of its cosets.
