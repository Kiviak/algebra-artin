suppose $s$ has has a right inverse $r$, then $s\circ r (1)=1=s(r(1))=r(1)+1$, we have $r(1)=0$, it is impossible, so $s$ has has no right inverse.  

for any $K\in \N,K>2$, let $t_K:\bold N \to \bold N$ and define 
$t_K(n) = \begin{cases}
   1 &\text{if } n\in \{1,K\} \\
   K-1 &\text{if } n=2 \\
   n-1 &\text{if } n\in \bold N\backslash \{1,2,K\} \\
\end{cases}$
it is easy to verify $t_K \circ s(n)=n$, we have $s$ has infinitely many left inverses.
