it is easy to verify $H$ is a normal subgroup. the set of cosets of $H$ is $\left\{\{re^{ix},re^{i(x+\pi/2)},re^{i(x+\pi)},re^{i(x+3\pi/2)}\}:r,x\in \R, r>0,0\le x<\pi/2\right\}$.  
let $\varphi: G\to G$ and $\varphi(z)=z^4$. if $z_1,z_2\in G$, since $\varphi(z_1z_2)=(z_1z_2)^4=\varphi(z_1)\varphi(z_2)$, we have $\varphi$ is a homomorphism. and it is easy to verify that $\varphi$ is surjective. since $\ker \varphi=H$, from Theorem $2.12.10$ we have $G/H$ is isomorphic to $G$.
