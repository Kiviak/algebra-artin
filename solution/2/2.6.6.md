suppose there exists $C\in GL_2(\R)$ such that $CA=BC$, let 
$C=\begin{bmatrix}
   a & b \\
   c & d
\end{bmatrix}$
where $a,b,c,d \in \R$ and $ad-bc \not =0$. since $CA=BC$, we have $a=0$ and $b=c\not=0$. it is clear $A$ and $B$ are conjugate elements of the group $GL_2(\R)$. since $\det C=-b^2<0$, we have $A$ and $B$ are not conjugate elements of the group $SL_2(\R)$.
