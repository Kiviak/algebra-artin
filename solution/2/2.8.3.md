we use the principle of strong induction to prove every group whose order is a power of a prime $p$ contains an element of order $p$.  
let $n,k\in \N$ and $n,k>0$.
1. since $p$ is a prime, a group of order $p$ is a cyclic group, it is clear the group contains an element of order $p$.
2. suppose that for $n<k$, a group of order $p^n$ contains an element of order $p$. then let $G$ be a group of order $p^{k}$, let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$, we have $|H|\in \{1,p,\cdots,p^k\}$. let $a \in G$ and $a\not =1$, since $\lang a \rang$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $|\lang a \rang|$ is $p^{t}$, where $1\le t \le k$. 
    - if $t=k$, then $G$ is cyclic, it is easy to verify $G$ contains an element of order $p$.
    - if $t<k$, since $\lang a \rang$ is a group of order $p^{t}$, then it contains an element of order $p$, that is $G$ contains an element of order $p$.  
    
    in summary, we have a group of order $p^k$ contains an element of order $p$.
