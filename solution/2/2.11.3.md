let $G=\lang x \rang,G'=\lang y \rang$ be two infinite cyclic groups.  
suppose that $G\times G'$ is infinite cyclic, then there exists $a\in G,b \in G'$ such that $G\times G'=\lang (a,b) \rang$. since $(x,1),(1,y)\in G\times G'$, then there exists $m,n\in \Z$ such that $(a^m,b^m)=(x,1)$ and $(a^n,b^n)=(1,y)$, we have $b=1$ and $b^n=y$, it is impossible.  
thus, the product of two infinite cyclic groups is not infinite cyclic.
