$1=(xy)^2=xyxy$, then $xy=y^{-1}x^{-1}=yx$. 
- if $a,b\in H$, then there exists $i,j,k,h\in \N$ such that $a=x^iy^j$ and $b=x^ky^h$, then $ab=(x^iy^j)(x^ky^h)=x^{i+k}y^{j+h}$. since $i+k\equiv 0$ or $1 \pmod 2$, and $j+h\equiv 0$ or $1 \pmod 2$, it is clear $ab \in H$.
- $1\in H$.
- it is easy to verify every element of $H$ has an inverse.  

in summary, $H$ is a subgroup of $G$.
- it is clear $x,y,xy \not =1$.  
- suppose $x=y$, then $xy=x^2=1$, it is impossible. thus, we have $x \not =y$.
- suppose $x=xy$, then $x^2=x(xy)=y=1$, it is impossible. thus, we have $x \not =xy$. similarly, we have $y \not =xy$.

in summary, we have $|H|=4$.
