let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$, since $|H|$ divides $|G|$, we have $|H|\in \{1,2,11,22\}$. since $y\notin \lang x \rang$, it is clear $y\not =1$. let $m=|\lang x \rang|$ and $n=|\lang y \rang|$, then $m,n \in \{2,11,22\}$.
- if one of $m,n$ is $22$, it is clear the subgroup generated by these $x$ and $y$ is the whole group $G$.
- if $m=n=2$, it is easy to verify $xy\not=x$ and $xy\not=y$. 
    - if $|\lang xy \rang|=2$, then $K=\{1,x,y,xy\}$ is a subgroup of $G$, since $|K|=4$, it is impossible.
    - if $|\lang xy \rang|=11$, since $11$ is a prime, then the order of any element of $\lang xy \rang$ is $11$. thus, we must have $\lang xy \rang\not =x\lang xy \rang$. since the left cosets of a subgroup of a group partition the group, and $|\lang xy \rang|+|x\lang xy \rang|=22$, we have the subgroup generated by $x$ and $y$ is the whole group $G$.
- if $m=11$, since $y\notin \lang x \rang$, it is clear $\lang x \rang\not =y\lang x \rang$. since the left cosets of a subgroup of a group partition the group, and $|\lang x \rang|+|y\lang x \rang|=22$, we have the subgroup generated by $x$ and $y$ is the whole group $G$.
- if $n=11$ and $m=2$, since $11$ is a prime, then the order of any element of $\lang y \rang$ is $11$. thus, we must have $\lang y \rang\not =x\lang y \rang$. since the left cosets of a subgroup of a group partition the group, and $|\lang y \rang|+|x\lang y \rang|=22$, we have the subgroup generated by $x$ and $y$ is the whole group $G$.  

in summary, we have the subgroup generated by $x$ and $y$ is the whole group $G$.
