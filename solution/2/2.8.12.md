1. $1\in S$.
2. suppose that there exists $b \in S$ such that $b^{-1} \notin S$, then $1=b^{-1}b\in b^{-1}S$, then $1 \in b^{-1}S \cap S$, we have $b^{-1}S = S$, then $b^{-1}=b^{-1}1\in S$, but it is impossible. thus, for any $b \in S$, we have $b^{-1} \in S$.  
3. suppose that there exists $b,c \in S$ such that $bc \notin S$, note that we have proved $b^{-1},c^{-1} \in S$, then $b=(bc)c^{-1} \in (bc)S$, then $b\in (bc)S \cap S$, we have $(bc)S = S$, then $bc \in S$, but it is impossible. thus, if $b,c \in S$, we have $bc \in S$.

in summary, we have $S$ is a subgroup of $G$.
