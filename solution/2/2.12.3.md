let $A$ be an element of the partition, let $a \in A$ and $a\not =1$, since $a1=1a=a \in A$, we have $AN\sub A$ and $NA\sub A$. it is clear $A \sub AN$ and $A \sub NA$. in summary, we have $AN=NA=A$.
- $1\in N$.
- let $b \in N$. suppose $b^{-1} \notin N$, then there exists $M$ such that $b^{-1} \in M$. since $MN=M$, then $1=b^{-1}b\in M$, it is impossible. thus, we must have if $b\in N$, then $b^{-1}\in N$.
- let $b,c \in N$. suppose $bc \notin N$, then there exists $M$ such that $bc \in M$. since $MN=M$ and $c^{-1}\in N$, then $b=(bc)c^{-1}\in M$, it is impossible. thus, we must have if $b,c\in N$, then $bc\in N$.  

in summary, $N$ is subgroup of $G$.   
if $n \in N$ and $g \in G$, then there exists $A,B$ such that $g\in A$ and $g^{-1}\in B$. since $1=gg^{-1}\in N$, we have $AB\sub N$. since $AN=A$, then $(gn)g^{-1}\in(AN)B=AB$, then $gng^{-1}\in N$, that is $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.  
let $H$ be an element of the partition, let $a \in H$ and $a\not =1$. it is clear $aN\sub HN=H$. suppose there exists $b \in H$ such that $b \notin aN$. let $a^{-1} \in K$, since $HK\sub N$, then $ba^{-1}\in HK \sub N$, then there exists $n \in N$ such that $ba^{-1}=n$, we have $b \in Na=aN$, it is impossible. thus, $H \sub aN$. in summary, we have $H=aN$.
