if $\overline{2}$ has a multiplicative inverse, then there exists a positive integer $k<n$ such that $\overline{2}\overline{k}=\overline{1}$, then there exists $s \in \Z$ such that $2k=1+ns$. since $1<2k<2n$, we have $s=1$, then $2k=1+n$. thus, 2 must divide $1+n$, we have $1+n \equiv 0 \pmod 2$, that is $n \equiv 1 \pmod 2$.   
since $n$ must be positive and if $n=1$, $\overline{2}$ doesn't have a multiplicative inverse, we have $n \equiv 1 \pmod 2$ and $n >1$.
