let $x,y\in G$, if $\varphi$ is a homomorphism, then $\varphi(xy)=\varphi(x)\varphi(y)$, that is $xyxy=x^2y^2$, we have $yx=xy$, that is $G$ is abelian.  
if $\varphi$ is bijective, then $\ker \varphi=\{1\}$. since $\varphi(x)=x^2$, it is clear any element of order $2$ is in $\ker \varphi$, we have the order of any element of $G$ is not $2$.  
if $\varphi$ is bijective, then $\varphi(G)=G$. let $x \in G$ and $n=|\lang x \rang|$, then $\varphi(\lang x \rang)=\{x^2,\cdots,(x^2)^{n-1}\}$. let $m=|\lang x^2 \rang|$, since $\lang x^2 \rang$ is a subgroup of $\lang x \rang$, then $m=n/\gcd(2,n)\le n$, we have $\varphi(\lang x \rang)=\lang x^2 \rang$. and since $\varphi$ is bijective, we must have $m=n$, that is $\gcd(2,n)=1$, we have $n$ is odd.  
in summary, if $G$ is abelian and the order of any element of $G$ is odd, then $\varphi$ is an automorphism of $G$.
