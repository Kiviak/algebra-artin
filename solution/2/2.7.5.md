1. let $E_1=\{(s,s): s \in \R \}$.
    - since $E_1$ contains the line $y=x$, then the reflexive property is satisfied.
    - since $E_1$ is symmetrical about the line $y=x$, then the symmetric property is satisfied.
    - if $(a,b),(b,c)\in E_1$, then $a=b=c$, then $(a,c)=(b,b)\in E_1$, we have the transitive property is satisfied.
2. the empty set.
    - the empty set doesn't contain the line $y=x$, then the reflexive property is not satisfied.
    - it is clear the symmetric property and the transitive property are satisfied.
3. let $E_2=\{ xy+1=0 \}$.
    - since $E_2$ doesn't contain the line $y=x$, then the reflexive property is not satisfied.
    - since $E_2$ is symmetrical about the line $y=x$, then the symmetric property is satisfied.
    - since $(-1/2,2),(2,-1/2)\in E_2$, it is clear $(-1/2,-1/2)\notin E_2$, we have the transitive property is not satisfied.
4. let $E_3=\{ x^2y-xy^2-x+y=0 \}$.
    - since $x^2y-xy^2-x+y=(x-y)(xy-1)$, then $E_3$ contains the line $y=x$ and is symmetrical about the line $y=x$, we have the reflexive property and the symmetric property are satisfied.
    - if $(a,b),(b,c)\in E_3$, then $a-b=0$ or $ab-1=0$, and $b-c=0$ or $bc-1=0$, it is easy to verify $(a,c)\in E_3$, we have the transitive property is satisfied.
