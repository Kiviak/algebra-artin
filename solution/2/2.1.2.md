1. $\ell ar=r=\ell (ar)=\ell$, we have $\ell=r$, then $a$ is invertible and $r$ is its inverse.
2. suppose $a$ have two inverses $b,c$, then $abc=c=bac=b(ac)=b$, we have $b=c$, then the inverse of $a$ is unique.
3. $b^{-1}a^{-1}ab=abb^{-1}a^{-1}=1$, we have $ab$ is invertible and $(ab)^{-1}=b^{-1}a^{-1}$.
4. for an example that illustrates this statement, see Exercise $2.1.3$.
