1. if $G=\{1\}$.
    - it is clear $G$ contains no proper subgroup.  
2. if $|G|>1$.
    - let $x \in G$ and $x \not =1$, if $|\lang x \rang |=\infty$, then $|\lang x^2 \rang |=\infty$, it is clear $\lang x^2 \rang$ is a proper subgroup of $G$. thus, the element of $G$ which contains no proper subgroup, has finite order.  
    - let $G$ be a group which contains no proper subgroup. suppose $|G|=\infty$, if $x\in G$ and $x \not =1$, since $|\lang x \rang |<\infty$, then $\lang x \rang$ is a proper subgroup of $G$, but it is impossible. thus, we have $|G|$ is finite.  
    - suppose $G$ is not cyclic, then there exists $x,y\in G$ such that $y \notin \lang x \rang$, then $\lang x \rang$ is a proper subgroup of $G$, but it is impossible. thus, $G$ is cyclic.  
    - since $G$ is cyclic and $|G|$ is finite, let $G=\lang x \rang$, if $|G|$ is not a prime, then there exists $a,b \in \Z, a,b\ge 2$ such that $|G|=ab$, then the order of $x^a$ is $b$, then $\lang x^a \rang$ is a proper subgroup of $G$, but it is impossible. thus, we have $G$ is cyclic and $|G|$ is a prime.  

in summary, we have $G$ is cyclic and $|G|$ is a prime or $1$.
