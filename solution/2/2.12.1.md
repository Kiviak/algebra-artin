suppose that if a subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is not normal, then the product of every pair of left cosets $aH$ and $bH$  is a coset.  
since $H$ is not normal, then there exists $g\in G, h\in H$ such that $ghg^{-1}\notin H$, it is clear $g,g^{-1}\notin H$. since $(g1)(g^{-1}1)\in H$, we have $(gH)(g^{-1}H)=H$, then $ghg^{-1}=(gh)(g^{-1}1)\in H$, it is impossible.  
thus, we have if a subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is not normal, there are left cosets $aH$ and $bH$ whose product is not a coset.
