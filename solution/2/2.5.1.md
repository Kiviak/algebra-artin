1. if $G$ is cyclic, then there exists $a\in G$ such that $G=\lang a \rang$. let $x$ be any element of $G$, there exists $n\in \Z$ such that $x=a^n$, then $\varphi(x)=\varphi(a^n)=(\varphi(a))^n$, we have $\varphi(G)=\lang \varphi(a) \rang$. and since $\varphi$ is surjective, we have $G'=\varphi(G)=\lang \varphi(a) \rang$, that is $G'$ is cyclic.
 2. if $g_1,g_2 \in G'$, then there exists $h_1,h_2\in G$ such that $\varphi(h_1)=g_1$ and $\varphi(h_2)=g_2$. if $G$ is abelian, we have $h_1 h_2=h_2 h_1$, then $g_1 g_2=\varphi(h_1 h_2)=\varphi(h_2 h_1)=\varphi(h_2) \varphi(h_1)=g_2 g_1$, we have $G'$ is abelian.
