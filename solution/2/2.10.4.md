let $\varphi:G\to G'$ be a surjective group homomorphism with kernel $K$. let $E=\{aH:a\in G\}$ be the set of left cosets of $H$ and $F=\{bH':b\in G'\}$ be the set of left cosets of $H'$, then $|E|=[G:H]$ and $|F|=[G':H']$.  
let $f:E\to F$ and $f(aH)=\varphi(a)H'$, it is clear $f$ is surjective. suppose there exists $aH,cH\in E$ such that $aH\not =cH$ and $f(aH)=f(cH)$, then $\varphi(a)H'=\varphi(c)H'$, then there exists $h\in H$ such that $\varphi(a)=\varphi(c)\varphi(h)=\varphi(ch)$, we have $a\in (ch)K$, then there exists $k\in K$ such that $a=(ch)k=c(hk)$. since $K\sub H$, then $hk\in H$, we have $a\in cH$, then $aH=cH$, it is impossible. thus, we have $f$ is injective.  
in summary, since $f$ is bijective, we have $|E|=|F|$, that is $[G:H] = [G':H']$.
