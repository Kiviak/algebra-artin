let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. since $|G|=25$ and $|H|$ divides $|G|$, we have $|H| \in \{1,5,25\}$. if $|H|=1$, then $H=\{1\}$. thus, $G$ must contain subgroups of order $5$ or $25$. if $|H|=25$, then there exists $x\in G$ such that $H=\lang x \rang$, it is easy to verify $\lang x^5 \rang$ is a subgroup of $G$ and $|\lang x^5 \rang|=5$. in summary, we have $G$ has at least one subgroup of order $5$.  
suppose $G$ contains only one subgroup of order $5$ and is not a cyclic group, since $|H| \in \{1,5,25\}$, then $G$ only has two subgroups: one of order $1$ and the other of order $5$, we have $|G|=5$, it is impossible. thus, if $G$ contains only one subgroup of order $5$, then it is a cyclic group.
