if $ab$ has finite order $n$ and $ba$ has finite order $m$, then $1=(ab)^n=a(ba)^n a^{-1}$, we have $(ba)^n=1$, then $m$ divides $n$. similarly, $n$ divides $m$, we have $n=m$.  
suppose $ab$ has finite order $n$ and $ba$ has infinite order, then $(ba)^n=1$, it is impossible.  
suppose $ba$ has finite order $m$ and $ab$ has infinite order, then $(ab)^m=1$, it is impossible.  
in summary, we claim $ab$ and $ba$ have the same order.
