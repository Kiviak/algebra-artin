let $H$ be a normal subgroup of order $3$ and $K$ be a normal subgroup of order $5$. since $3,5$ are prime, we have $H,K$ are cyclic, $H\cap K=\{1\}$ and $H\times K$ is a cyclic group of order $15$.  
let $\varphi:H\times K\to G$ and $\varphi((h,k))=hk$. since $H$ is normal, from Proposition $2.11.4$ we have $\varphi(H\times K) =HK$ is a subgroup of $G$.  
let $f:H\times K\to HK$ and $f((h,k))=hk$. since $H,K\sub HK$, then $H,K$ are normal subgroups of $HK$, from Proposition $2.11.4$ we have $f$ is an isomorphism. since $H\times K$ is a cyclic group of order $15$, then $HK$ is a cyclic group of order $15$.  
in summary, since $HK$ is a cyclic subgroup of order $15$, then $G$ contains an element of order $15$.
