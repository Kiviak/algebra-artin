let $G$ be a group of order $35$ and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. since $|G|=35$ and $|H|$ divides $|G|$, we have $|H| \in \{1,5,7,35\}$.  
- if $G$ is cyclic, it is easy to verify $G$ contains elements of order $5$ and $7$.  
- suppose $G$ is not cyclic and contains no elements of order $7$, then the order of every nontrivial subgroup of $G$ is $5$. let $H_1,H_2$ be two subgroups of order $5$, since $5$ is a prime, if $H_1\not =H_2$, we have $H_1 \cap H_2=\{1\}$. thus, let $n$ be the number of nontrivial subgroups of $G$, we must have $(5-1)n+1=|G|=35$, but it is impossible. thus, if $G$ is not cyclic, then $G$ must contain elements of order $7$. similarly, if $G$ is not cyclic, then $G$ must contain elements of order $5$.  

in summary, $G$ contains elements of order $5$ and $7$.
