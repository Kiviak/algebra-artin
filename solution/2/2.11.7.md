let $h\in H$ and $n\in N$, we have $\varphi(hn)=\varphi(h)\varphi(n)=\varphi(h)1=h$.   
if $h_1,h_2\in H$ and $h_1\not =h_2$, we claim $h_1N\not =h_2N$. suppose $h_1N =h_2N$, then there exists $n_1 \in N$ such that $h_1=h_2n_1$, then $h_1=\varphi(h_1)=\varphi(h_2n_1)=h_2$, it is impossible.  
since $|G|=|N||H|$, we have $\{hN:h\in H\}$ is a partition of $G$. thus, if $g\in G$, then there exists $h \in H$ such that $g\in hN$. we have $G=HN$.  
we claim $H\cap N=\{1\}$. suppose there exists $h_2\not =1$ such that $h_2\in H\cap N$. since $h_2\in H$, then $\varphi(h_2)=h_2$. and since $h_2\in N$, we have $\varphi(h_2)=1$, it is impossible.  
in summary, since $H\cap N=\{1\}$, then the product map is injective. since $G=HN$, then the product map is surjective. thus, the product map is bijective.
