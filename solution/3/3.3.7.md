let $S=\{X_i Y_j^t:i,j\in \N,0<i\le m,0<j\le n\}$.   
let $e_{i,j}$ be an $m\times n$ matrix which has a $1$ at $i$ row, $j$ column as its only nonzero entry. let $B=\{e_{i,j}:i,j\in \N,0<i\le m,0<j\le n\}$, it is clear $B$ is a basis for the vector space $\R^{m\times n}$ of all $m\times n$ matrices.  
let $e'_i$ be an $m\times 1$ matrix which has a $1$ at $i$ row, $1$ column as its only nonzero entry, let $f_j$ be an $n\times 1$ matrix which has a $1$ at $j$ row, $1$ column as its only nonzero entry.   
it is easy to verify $e_{i,j}=e'_i f_j^t$. since $e'_i\in \R^m$ and $f_j\in \R^n$, then there exists $a_1,\dots,a_m\in \R,b_1,\dots,b_n\in \R$ such that $e'_i=\sum_{k=1}^m a_k X_k$ and $f_j=\sum_{s=1}^n b_s Y_s$, then $e_{i,j}=(\sum_{k=1}^m a_k X_k)(\sum_{s=1}^n b_s Y_s^t)=\sum_{k=1}^m\sum_{s=1}^n a_k b_s X_k Y_s^t$, we have $B\sub \text{Span}\ S$. thus, $S$ spans the vector space $\R^{m\times n}$ of all $m\times n$ matrices. note that $|S|\le mn$ and $|B|=mn$, then $S$ must be a basis for the vector space $\R^{m\times n}$ of all $m\times n$ matrices.
