let $e_{i,j}$ be an $n\times n$ matrix which has a $1$ at $i$ row, $j$ column as its only nonzero entry, let $A_{i,j}=e_{i,j}+e_{j,i}$ for $i\not=j$ and $A_{i,j}=e_{i,j}$ for $i=j$, let $B=\{A_{i,j}:i,j\in \N,0<i\le n,0<j\le n\}$, it is clear $B$ is a basis for the space of $n\times n$ symmetric matrices $(A^t=A)$.
