let $B=(v_1,\dots,v_n)$ and $A=[v_1,\dots,v_n]$.  
$B$ is a basis $\implies$ $A$ is invertible:
- note that $0\in F^n$ and $0v_1+\cdots+0v_n=0$, since $B$ is a basis, then $0$ is the unique solution of $AX=0$, we have $A$ is invertible. 

$A$ is invertible $\implies$ $B$ is a basis:
- let $C\in F^n$, since $A$ is invertible, it is clear $AX=C$ has the unique solution $A^{-1}C$, from Proposition $3.4.14$ we have $B$ is a basis.
