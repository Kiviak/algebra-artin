let
$A=\begin{bmatrix}
   0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0
\end{bmatrix},
B=\begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 0 \\
   0 & 1
\end{bmatrix},
C=\begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 1 \\
   1 & 0
\end{bmatrix},
D=\begin{bmatrix}
   0 & 1 \\
   1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$
let $F=\{A,B,C,D\}$ and $F_1=\{B,C,D\}$. 
- it is easy to verify that if $E_1,E_2\in F$, then $E_1+E_2\in F$.
- it is clear addition is commutative and associative.
- let $E\in F$, since $E+A=A+E=E$, then $A$ is the zero element.
- let $E\in F$, since $E+E=0$, then $E$ is the inverse of $E$, we have every element of $F$ has an inverse.

thus, addition makes $F$ into an abelian group.

- it is easy to verify that if $E_1,E_2\in F_1$, then $E_1E_2\in F_1$.
- it is clear multiplication is associative.
- let $E\in F_1$, since $EB=BE=E$, then $B$ is the identity element.
- since $CD=DC=1$, we have every element of $F_1$ has an inverse and $F_1$ is abelian.

thus, multiplication makes $F_1$ into an abelian group.  
if $E\in F$, since $AE=EA=0$, then multiplication is commutative.  
if $E_1,E_2,E_3\in F$, it is easy to verify that $E_1(E_2+E_3)=E_1E_2+E_1E_3$.  
in summary, $F$ is a field.
