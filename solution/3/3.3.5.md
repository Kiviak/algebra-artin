$W$ is a subspace $\implies$ $W$ is the space of solutions of some system of homogeneous linear equations $AX=0$:
- since $W$ is a subspace, let $m=\dim W$, then $0\le m\le n$. let $e_i$ be an $n\times 1$ matrix which has a $1$ at $i$ row, $1$ column as its only nonzero entry, let $B=\{e_i:i\in \N,0<i\le n\}$, it is clear $B$ is a basis of $V$. since $W$ is a subspace of $V$, then $W$ contains $m$ elements of $B$. let $J=\{e_i:e_i \in W\}$, then $J$ is a basis of $W$. let $A$ be an $(n-m)\times n$ matrix and 
$A=\begin{bmatrix}
   e_k^t \\
   \vdots
\end{bmatrix}$
where $e_k\notin J$. note if $k\not= i$, we have $e_k^t e_i=0$. thus, it is clear $Ae_i=0$ for $e_i\in J$ and $Ae_i\not=0$ for $e_i\notin J$, we have $W$ is the space of solutions of $AX=0$.

$W$ is the space of solutions of some system of homogeneous linear equations $AX=0$ $\implies$ $W$ is a subspace:
- $0\in W$.
- if $v,w\in W$, then $A(v+w)=Av+Aw=0$, we have $v+w\in W$.
- if $c\in F$ and $v\in W$, then $A(cv)=c(Av)=0$, we have $cv\in W$.
