let $B=\{v_1,v_2\}$ be a basis of $V$.  
suppose that there doesn't exist $v\in V$ such that $(v,T(v))$ is a basis of $V$, then $v$ and $T(v)$ are not independent. thus, there exists $c_1,c_2\in F$ such that $T(v_1)=c_1 v_1$ and $T(v_2)=c_2 v_2$. let $v_3=v_1+v_2$, then there exists $c_3\in F$ such that $T(v_3)=c_3 v_3=c_3(v_1+v_2)=T(v_1)+T(v_2)=c_1 v_1+c_2 v_2$, we have $c_1=c_2=c_3$, then $T$ is multiplication by a scalar, it is impossible.  
thus, there is a vector $v$ in $V$ such that $(v,T(v))$ is a basis of $V$. since $T(T(v))\in V$, then there exists $a,b\in F$ such that $T(T(v))=av+bT(v)$. we have $T((v,T(v))=(T(v),T(T(v)))=$  
$(v,T(v))
\begin{bmatrix}
   0 & a   \\
   1 & b 
\end{bmatrix}$
thus, the matrix of $T$ is
$\begin{bmatrix}
   0 & a   \\
   1 & b 
\end{bmatrix}$
