since $\det\ (\lambda I-A)=\det\ (\lambda I-A)^t=\det\ (\lambda I-A^t)$, we have $A$ and $A^t$ have the same eigenvalues.  
let
$A=\begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 1   \\
   0 & 2 
\end{bmatrix}$
since $A[1,1]^t=2[1,1]^t$, then $[1,1]^t$ is an eigenvector of $A$. and $A^t[1,1]^t=[1,3]^t$, since $[1,3]^t$ and $[1,1]^t$ are independent, then $[1,1]^t$ is not an eigenvector of $A^t$. thus, $A$ and $A^t$ may not have the same eigenvectors.
