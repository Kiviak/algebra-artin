Let $A$ be an $m\times n$ matrix of rank $r$, let $I$ be a set of $r$ row indices such that the corresponding rows of $A$ are independent, and let $J$ be a set of $r$ column indices such that the corresponding columns of $A$ are independent. Let $M$ denote the $r\times r$ submatrix of $A$ obtained by taking rows from $I$ and columns from $J$. Prove that $M$ is invertible.
