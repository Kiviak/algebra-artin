Determine all possible Jordan forms for a matrix whose characteristic polynomial is (f + 2)2(r-5) $5$. (b) What are the possible Jordan forms for a matrix whose characteristic polynomial is (/ + 2)2(/ â€” 5) , when space of eigenvectors with eigenvalue $2$ is one-dimensional, and the space of eigenvectors with eigenvalue $5$ is two-dimensional?
