Let $S$ be a set with a law of composition: A partition $\Pi_1\cup \Pi_2\cup\cdots$ of $S$ is compatible with the law of composition if for all $i$ and $j$, the product set
$$\Pi_i\Pi_j=\{xy: x\in \Pi_i,y\in \Pi_j \}$$
is contained in a single subset $\Pi_k$ of the partition.
1. The set $\Z$ of integers can be partitioned into the three sets $[\text{Pos}],[\text{Neg}],[\{0\}]$. Discuss the extent to which the laws of composition $+$ and $\times$ are compatible with this partition.
2. Describe all partitions of the integers that are compatible with the operation $+$.
