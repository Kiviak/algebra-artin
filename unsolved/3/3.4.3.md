Let $B=(v_1,\dots,v_n)$ be a basis of a vector space $V$. Prove that one can get from $B$ to any other basis $B'$ by a finite sequence of steps of the following types:
1. Replace $v_i$ by $v_i+av_j$, $i\not=j$, for some $a\in F$.
2. Replace $v_i$ by $cv_i$ for some $c\not=0$.
3. Interchange $v_i$ and $v_j$.
